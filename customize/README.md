## Customization ##

This short tutorial shows how to customize the workshop content for personalized workshop delivery.

### Steps ###

#### Create own copy of the repository of workshop content ####

Open the browser and login to https://github.com In case you don't have an account you need to sign up for a new account.

Once you logged in click on top right corner into the context menu marked with sign "+" and select "Import repository"

In the field Old repository type: 'https://github.com/oracle/cloud-native-devops-workshop' and in the field "Name" type 'cloud-native-devops-workshop'. Press the button "Begin import"

After the import is done your repository is available at https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/cloud-native-devops-workshop

#### Modify the content in personalized workshop ####

The easiest possibility to customize is available through deleting not needed contet. So if you would like to deliver that content only with a subset of tutorials then modify the Table of Contest file  To do so open your repository in the browser https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/cloud-native-devops-workshop.

Select the file "README.md"

Click on the icon "Edit this file"

You will open the metadata editor of tabale of the contest. Customize it to your needs (for example by removing not needed tutorials). Click on 'Commit changes" at the end.

#### Make needed changes in the VirtualBox images (optional - only if you are using them) ####

Every participant who uses the distributed by oracle VirtualBox image will need to change the following:
+ modify the file /u01/content/cloud-native-devops-workshop/control/uPdateDemos.sh and place the proper github repository URL
+ Click on UpdateDemos script on the Desktop
